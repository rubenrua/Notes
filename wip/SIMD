 ISEs
--------------

x86:

* MMX - Launched in 1997, first SIMD in Intel Processors, 64-bit registers, historic
* SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) - Launched in 1999, 128-bit registers
* SSE2 - Launched in 2000, many new instructions
* SSE3 - Launched in 2004, first horizontal instructions
* SSSE3 (Supplemental SSE3) - Launched in 2006, new instructions but most importantly pshufb shuffle instruction, arguably the most important instruction in video processing
* SSE4 - Launched in 2008, many new instructions including packed minimum and maximum.
* AVX - Launched in 2011, 256-bit registers (float only) and new three-operand syntax
* AVX2 - Launched in 2013, 256-bit registers for integer instructions
* AVX512 - Launched in 2017, 512-bit registers, new operation mask feature. These had limited use at the time in FFmpeg because of CPU frequency downscaling when new instructions were used. Full 512-bit shuffle (permute) with vpermb.
* AVX512ICL - Launched 2019, no more clock frequency downscaling.
* AVX10 - Upcoming

ARM:

* NEON
* SVE (from ARMv8.2-A)
* SVE2 (from ARMv8.6-A)

RISC-V:

* Vector Extension (RVV)
